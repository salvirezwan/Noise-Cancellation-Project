# Background Noise Cancellation

This is a Digital Signal Processing Project that reduces background noise of an audio file. Three filters are implemented:
- Weiner Filter
- Kalman Filter
- Spectral Subtraction
  
It also generates graphs to compare the performance of the three filters.

The project has been implemented in Python.
I collaborated with my classmates Kiran and Ifti for this project.
